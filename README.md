# BASF CHALLENGE. TEST 1&2. PYTHON with BEHAVE BDD framework
## TEST 1: Log In test
## TEST 2: Search test

## Pre-requisites

1. Python version 3 and pip
2. pipenv (pip install pipenv)

## Deployment

1. pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
2. pipenv shell

## Execution

1. export QKNOWS_USER={your username}
2. export QKNOWS_PASSWORD={your password}
3. behave --no-capture -f json -o reports/report.json

## Project lay out

Since it is a BDD project, it uses feature files for tests definition. The test plan is stored at "features/" folder, 
having each test a dedicated feature file

BDD needs a "glue" code, a decoder, in order to understand the feature files language. This code is stored at "steps/"
folder. This code performs the orchestrating of the test steps

There is also a "sut/" folder, which stores the code which controls the system under tests.

Under "sut/" folder there are two subfolders
- "model/": this one hosts the pages objects, which provides "gears" to perform actions
- "selectors/": this one hosts the selectors of the web elements in order to find them by the model. 
  They are kept separated in order to use them as configuration files, easier to maintain.

## TEST 1: Log In

It uses "features/As a QKnows user I want to successfully log in.feature.feature" as BDD feature file

## TEST 2: Search

It uses "features/As a QKnows user I want to check my search results.feature" as BDD feature file


## REPORT

Json report can be found at "reports/report.json"

## RESULTS


```
Feature: As a QKnows user I want to check my search results # features/As a QKnows user I want to check my search results.feature:1

  Scenario: As a QKnows user I want to check my search results  # features/As a QKnows user I want to check my search results.feature:2
    Given I proceed to QKnows main page                         # steps/search.py:6 11.860s
    When I search for a random meaningful word                  # steps/search.py:13 0.553s
    Then the first 3 results get the searched word              # steps/search.py:20
    Then the first 3 results get the searched word              # steps/search.py:20 0.680s

Feature: As a QKnows user I want to successfully log in # features/As a QKnows user I want to successfully log in.feature:1

  Scenario: As a QKnows user I want to successfully log in  # features/As a QKnows user I want to successfully log in.feature:2
    Given I open QKnows log in page                         # steps/login.py:6 3.789s
    When I set my user credentials                          # steps/login.py:12 0.286s
    And I select Log In option                              # steps/login.py:17 4.160s
    Then I access QKnows main page                          # steps/login.py:29 0.067s
    And "search field" is visible                           # steps/login.py:35 0.034s
    And "search magnifier" is visible                       # steps/login.py:35 0.021s
    And "Upcoming Events section" is visible                # steps/login.py:35 0.017s
    And "News section" is visible                           # steps/login.py:35 0.016s
    And "access to Support chat" is visible                 # steps/login.py:35 0.016s

NOTE: Both tests are passed, but the assertion library is using stricter matcher conditions than the web search engine

For example, for "carbon" search, there is a result with "carbonate", which the library throws an error on

```
      Assertion Failed: 
      Expected: a string containing 'carbon'
           but: was 'The present invention relates to a process for the reduction of pitch in an aqueous medium generated in a papermaking or pulping process, comprising the following steps: a) providing an aqueous medium comprising pitch generated in a papermaking or pulping procâ€¦'
```

In any case, it gives me the opportunity to try screenshots generation
